### Problem Description
In the current educational landscape, students and educators face several challenges when it comes to acquiring and sharing study materials:

1. **Access Issues:** High-quality notes and textbooks are often limited to specific institutions or hard to obtain. Students may struggle to find relevant study materials that align with their curriculum or learning needs.
2. **Lack of Standardization:** Traditional platforms for buying and selling educational materials lack transparency and standardization in pricing and content quality, leading to inconsistencies and potential exploitation.
3. **Inefficient Marketplaces:** Existing marketplaces for educational materials are often centralized and may not provide a fair value exchange for creators and buyers. Additionally, traditional systems may lack mechanisms for verifying the authenticity and quality of content.
4. **Limited Recommendations:** Students and educators often struggle to find the right resources tailored to their needs due to a lack of personalized recommendations and relevant search capabilities.
